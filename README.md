#ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression & Streamlit

This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on clinical parameters using Machine Learning. The model is built with Logistic Regression and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, feature selection)

Model training with Logistic Regression

Evaluation using accuracy

Streamlit app for real-time prediction based on user input

User-friendly web interface to input health parameters (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)


ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Streamlit (deployment)


ðŸ“Š Use Case:

A simple, accessible tool to demonstrate how machine learning can assist in healthcare risk prediction, helping doctors and individuals in preliminary riskÂ assessment.
